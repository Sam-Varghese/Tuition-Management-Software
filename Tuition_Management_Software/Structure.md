# Structure Of Software

This md file contains blueprint for making the software. Here are some points that should be taken care while making the software:

1. A folder named Tuition_Magement_Software should contain all the files/programs necessary for successful execution of program.
1. Separate python files should be made for each new task so that management and complexity of this program can be reduced to best possible extent.
1. Every python file should be well documented.
