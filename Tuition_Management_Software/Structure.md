# Structure Of Software

This md file contains blueprint for making the software. Here are some points that should be taken care while making the software:

1. A folder named Tuition_Magement_Software should contain all the files/programs necessary for successful execution of program.
1. Separate python files should be made for each new task so that complexity of this program can be reduced to best possible extent.
1. Every python file should be well documented.
1. As this project would be using tkinter , do remeber to put print statements so that programmer , on seeing the cmd could come to know what is going on behind the scenes and should come to know if any error has occurred, or something unexpected is happening.
