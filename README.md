* Take the attendance of students of all classes.
* Study the attendance records of all students in order to catch students with very low attendances.

### Finance Section

* This would include knowing the names of students who have not paid monthly/yearly fees.
* This would also include making separate tabular records of the fees paid/dues of all students.
* This would also include the study of the income which is being generated by the tuition teacher so that he/she can get lots of insight on this area of tuition management.

### Pattern In Which Fees Is Required To Be Deposited

* Many tuitions are there which would ask students to give some fees every month.
* Tuitions may also ask students to give some particualar amount of fees in a year instead of asking for monthly fees submition.

I , being a tuition going student and son of a tuition teacher , have seen the hardships involved in the proper management of tuitions. I saw that usually all these works require approx 3-4hrs which can be automated and be done in just seconds.
